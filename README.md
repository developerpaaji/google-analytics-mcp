This repo contains the source code for running a local
[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that interacts with APIs for
[Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics).

on Discord.

## Tools 🛠️

The server uses the
[Google Analytics Admin API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/config/admin/v1)
and
[Google Analytics Data API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1)
to provide several
[Tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools) for use with LLMs.

### Retrieve property information 🟠

- `get_property_details`: Returns details about the configured property.
- `list_google_ads_links`: Returns a list of links to Google Ads accounts for
  the configured property.
- `list_property_annotations`: Returns annotations for the configured property.

### Run core reports 📙

- `run_report`: Runs a Google Analytics report using the Data API.
- `get_custom_dimensions_and_metrics`: Retrieves the custom dimensions and
  metrics for the configured property.

### Run realtime reports ⏳

- `run_realtime_report`: Runs a Google Analytics realtime report using the
  Data API.

## Setup instructions 🔧

✨ Watch the [Google Analytics MCP Setup
Tutorial](https://youtu.be/nS8HLdwmVlY) on YouTube for a step-by-step
walkthrough of these instructions.

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/nS8HLdwmVlY/mqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS8HLdwmVlY)

Setup involves the following steps:

1.  Configure Python.
1.  Configure credentials for Google Analytics.
1.  Configure Gemini.

### Configure Python 🐍

[Install pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/#install-pipx).

### Enable APIs in your project ✅

[Follow the instructions](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158841)
to enable the following APIs in your Google Cloud project:

* [Google Analytics Admin API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/analyticsadmin.googleapis.com)
* [Google Analytics Data API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/analyticsdata.googleapis.com)

### Configure credentials 🔑

Configure your [Application Default Credentials
(ADC)](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc).
Make sure the credentials are for a user with access to your Google Analytics
accounts or properties.

Credentials must include the Google Analytics read-only scope:

```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly
```

Check out
[Manage OAuth Clients](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/15549257)
for how to create an OAuth client.

Here are some sample `gcloud` commands you might find useful:

- Set up ADC using user credentials and an OAuth desktop or web client after
  downloading the client JSON to `YOUR_CLIENT_JSON_FILE`.

  ```shell
  gcloud auth application-default login \
    --scopes https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform \
    --client-id-file=YOUR_CLIENT_JSON_FILE
  ```

- Set up ADC using service account impersonation.

  ```shell
  gcloud auth application-default login \
    --impersonate-service-account=SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \
    --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
  ```

When the `gcloud auth application-default` command completes, copy the
`PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_JSON` file location printed to the console in the
following message. You'll need this for the next step!

```
Credentials saved to file: [PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_JSON]
```

### Configure Gemini

1.  Install [Gemini
    CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/cli/index.md)
    or [Gemini Code
    Assist](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Google.geminicodeassist).

1.  Create or edit the file at `~/.gemini/settings.json`, adding your server
    to the `mcpServers` list.

    Replace `PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_JSON` with the path you copied in the previous
    step.

    You must also add a `GA_PROPERTY_ID` attribute to the `env` object with
    your GA4 property ID. This configures which property the MCP server will
    use for all operations.

    We also recommend that you add a `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` attribute to the
    `env` object. Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` in the following example with the
    [project ID](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/7014113) of your
    Google Cloud project.

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "analytics-mcp": {
          "command": "pipx",
          "args": [
            "run",
            "analytics-mcp"
          ],
          "env": {
            "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS": "PATH_TO_CREDENTIALS_JSON",
            "GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
            "GA_PROPERTY_ID": "YOUR_GA4_PROPERTY_ID"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    > **Note:** You can find your GA4 property ID in Google Analytics under
    > Admin > Property Settings. It's a numeric ID like `123456789`.

## Try it out 🥼

Launch Gemini Code Assist or Gemini CLI and type `/mcp`. You should see
`analytics-mcp` listed in the results.

Here are some sample prompts to get you started:

- Ask what the server can do:

  ```
  what can the analytics-mcp server do?
  ```

- Ask about your Google Analytics property

  ```
  Give me details about my Google Analytics property
  ```

- Prompt for analysis:

  ```
  what are the most popular events in my Google Analytics property in the last 180 days?
  ```

- Ask about signed-in users:

  ```
  were most of my users in the last 6 months logged in?
  ```

- Ask about property configuration:

  ```
  what are the custom dimensions and custom metrics in my property?
  ```
